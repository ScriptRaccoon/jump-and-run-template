- push function is not completed yet:
    -- boxes can be pushed into rectangles
    -- boxes can sometimes be pushed into each other
    -- the problem is that during the push function between boxes,
        collision with rectangles is not tested anymore.

- when jumping continuously and moving right/left, the jumping stops

- during a jump to the right/left, it is hard to move it back to left/right

- refactor: much of collision logic can move to rectangle class

- get-variablen wie .left und .right f端r rectangles und damit f端r boxen, evtl auch setter

- brache eine listen f端r alle boxen , und eine liste f端r alle rechtecke die keine boxen sind
