- push function is not completed yet:
    -- boxes can be pushed into rectangles
    -- boxes can sometimes be pushed into each other
    -- the problem is that during the push function between boxes,
        collision with rectangles is not tested anymore.

- when jumping continuously and moving right/left, the jumping stops

- during a jump to the right/left, it is hard to move it back to left/right

- refactor: much of collision logic can move to rectangle class
